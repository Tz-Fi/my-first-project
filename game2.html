    <p>There is a famous riddle known as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem >Monty Holl Problem</a>.   
      The scenario is of a game show with 3 doors. Behind 2 are goats, the third has a car. 
      The participent is asked to open any one door, and is told s/he will get to keep whatever is behind it.
      After choosing a door, but before opening it, the gameshow host opens one of the other 2 doors to reveal a goat, and offers
      the participent the option to switch choices. The question is, should the particient switch choices? And what is the probability 
      of winning the car should s/he do so? <br />Rather than answer this mathematically, you can verify it empirically.<br />
      In the following game, the computer will randomly select a door to place the car behind. You will be able to make an initial choice, 
      after whcih the computer will reveal one of the goats, and you will be able to change your choice.
      This game will run for as long as you want it to, and keep track of how many goats and cars were won. Try various strategies and verify 
      for yourself whether or not it is a good idea to switch.
