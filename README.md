# My first Project
The purpose of this project was to try out the capabilities of Github. It consists of a "[homepage](https://tz-fi.github.io/my-first-project/)", with links to various subpages, each of which contain some form of game.

## [Game #1](https://tz-fi.github.io/my-first-project/game1.html)
Uses files: game1.html, game1.js, endmatter.css 

Game 1 is a rock-paper-scissor game. 
After each round the user can click the 'reset' button to play again.

## [Game #2](https://tz-fi.github.io/my-first-project/game2.html)
Uses files: game2.html, game2.js, endmatter.css

Game 2 is a simulator for the Monty Holl problem.
Continues for as long as the user is willing to play.

Other games will hopefully be added later.
